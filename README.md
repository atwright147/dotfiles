# Andy's Dotfiles

A set of custom dotfiles created to help me understand ZSH and stop relying on Oh-My-ZSH / Prezto.

It is designed around zplug. When you first start up your terminal with the custom .zshrc file it *should* install zplug, then install all of it's own dependencies.

I am trying to create a system similar to the way npm handles dependencies.
